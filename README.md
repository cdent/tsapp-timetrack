This is a time tracking SPA created with
[tsapp](http://tsapp.tiddlyspace.com) for use with
[TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com). Use it on TiddlySpace
yourself from http://timer.tiddlyspace.com/.

Time is tracked using tiddlers. Each tiddler has a title which is
the a Unix epoch timestamp and a tag indicating its category and
whether it is a stop or start. The SPA allows starting and stopping
time in multiple categories, and will display the current total for
all categories.

It is designed to be simple enough to use on tiny displays: Track
your time by selecting a category and hitting the button to start or
stop. Not pretty but functional:
